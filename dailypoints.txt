1.Event Loop:
* Event loop is the main reason that java script can perform asynchronous actions 
* By default javascipt runs the code line by line which can block the exection of 
  the remaining tasks if one task takes more time which in the middle of the event loop queue.
* To Deal with these kind of situations Eevent Loop uses "call backs" and "thread pools".
* If any task is time consuming it will be moved or offloaded to thread pool and executed in threadpool only.
* these time consuming tasks will be assosciated with call backs wich are call the event loop after executing the tasks by thread pool.
