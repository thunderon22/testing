Data Structures in pandas:
* Serieses: Serieses are 1D  labled arrays
Difference between mormal arrays and labled arrays:
Normal arrays will have nuemerical indexes , in labled arrays you can lable the indexes 
by your wish and you can access them by using  those indexes.

* DataFrames: Data Franes are 2D labled arrays , just like some typical 2D arrays 
Accessing of DataFrames can  be done by using methos they are loc[],iloc[]
iterating over rows and  columns  in  data_frame by using iterrows().
for i , j in data_frame.iterrows()

* Working with missing Data in pandas:
There are two parts in Dealing with missing data in  pandas , they are 
(i) Finding the missing data(Nulll , NA)
(ii) Dealing with the missing data(Null , NA)
 
 Finding Null Data:
 isnull() # returns true for na values.
 notnull() # returnd false for na values.
 Dealing with the missing Data:
 fillna() # Fill the nan values with anyother values.
 replace() #  replaces any value with another value not limited to nan values like fillna()

 * Sorting the values of data_frame():
 df.sort_values(ascending = true/false)
 
 *Gruoping Data :
  Splitting : It is a process in which we split data into group by applying some conditions on datasets.
  Applying : It is a process in which we apply a function to each group independently
  Combining : It is a process in which we combine different datasets after applying groupby and results into a data structure
